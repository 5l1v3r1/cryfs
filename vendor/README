This directory contains external projects, taken from the following locations:

googletest: https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/4e4df226fc197c0dda6e37f5c8c3845ca1e73a49
 - changed: added NOLINT comment as workaround for clang-tidy warning https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/853

spdlog: https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/tree/v0.16.3/include/spdlog

cryptopp: https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/tree/CRYPTOPP_7_0_0
 - changed: added CMakeLists.txt and cryptopp-config.cmake from https://github.com/noloader/cryptopp-cmake/tree/7f3b3540740b365bed673936852d70795c0104f3
 - changed: removed cmake warning from CMakeLists.txt

aws-sdk: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/tree/1.6.49
 - changed: removed all aws-cpp-sdk-* directories except aws-cpp-sdk-core and aws-cpp-sdk-s3. They're too large and not needed.
 - comment out "find_package(Git)" in root CMakeLists.txt because the .git directory isn't present. It doesn't need it anyways but would print a warning in the build otherwise.
